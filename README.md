SicPy
=====

A classic cryptography python module
------------------------------------

It started as a way of teaching myself some Ruby & Haskell, but I discovered Python...

This repo keeps the python development version.
I will compile it as cython code but I have still to decide if those will be on a different branch.

Sorry for the silly name.
