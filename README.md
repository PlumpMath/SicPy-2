classic-crypto
==============

This project is a way I have found to learn more Ruby and Haskell.

I will be implementing simple crypto in both languages and sometimes in C too (to keep it fresh!).

I will be implementing at least those ciphers:
  * Julius Caesar cipher
  * Monoalphabetic cipher
  * Vigen√®re cipher

All with some method of cryptanalysis
